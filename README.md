## 🎯 Usage

### Viewing the Template
Simply open `index.html` in any web browser to see the TaskFlow design template.

### Customizing the Design

**Changing Colors:**
Edit `CSS/main.css` to modify the color scheme:
```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #4CAF50;
  --background-color: #f5f5f5;
  /* Modify these variables to change colors */
}
```

**Adding Static Tasks:**
Edit `index.html` to add example tasks:
```html
<div class="task-item">
  <input type="checkbox" class="task-checkbox">
  <span class="task-text">Your task here</span>
  <button class="delete-btn">Delete</button>
</div>
```

**Changing Layout:**
Modify `CSS/corner.css` for layout adjustments like spacing, sizing, and positioning.

### Note on Interactivity
This is a static HTML/CSS template. The checkboxes and buttons are visual elements only and don't perform actions. To add functionality, you would need to:
- Learn basic JavaScript
- Add event listeners and functions
- Implement local storage for saving tasks

**Why HTML/CSS Only?**
- Perfect for learning web development fundamentals
